# week 11 and 12

# Final Project!

## Final Project Goals
It's time to get started on your final projects! Over the course of your time at Makers you've learned a bunch of useful skills and it's really important that you keep working on them for the next two weeks. <br/>

Even if your final project looks awesome, if your team's process was poor then it's not going to have been a great outcome for you, and your time spent working on it is likely to be far less enjoyable.<br/>

With this in mind, coaches will be looking for a few things from you as a measure of how well your team is working.<br/>

### Testing
 90% or greater test coverage.
 Unit tests:
 test one piece of your own logic.
 fail if that logic breaks.
 pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
 You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
 Every feature is tested from the user's perspective. <br/>

### Good distribution of work
 Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
 explain why any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
 explain how any aspect of the application works.
 Every member of the team has made commits.
 Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request. <br/>

### Quality of work
 Commit messages are clear and composed of:
 a single line describing the changes made.
 a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.
 The linter passes on all commits.
 All commits have a low complexity score.
 All pull requests are peer reviewed.

### Documentation
 There is up-to-date documentation:
 a project description.
 how to install and run it.
 how to run tests.
