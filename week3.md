# Week 3

## Weekly goals

> This week, your objectives are:

Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

#### Plans to achieve
> Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

This module is designed to be worked on during a week. Here's a suggested pace â€” you might find you need more (or less) time than this to complete the challenges, and that's OK.

Day 1: SQL bites.
Days 2-5: Rest of the challenges
Solo challenge at the end of the week.
